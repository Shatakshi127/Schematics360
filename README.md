# Schematics360

Schematic360 is an extensive website, which serves as a central hub for acquiring detailed information on government schemes and important card particulars. In the modern, rapidly evolving world, keeping up-to-date with the numerous government initiatives and programs can feel overwhelming. The goal is to make this process more manageable and efficient by offering a user-friendly platform that grants you convenient access to all the pertinent information you require.

Schematic360 is a website overhaul of ScholarVerse, my previous project which was robust online portal, giving insights of courses offered by National and International Institutions, along with Scholarships and Grants based on merit, income etc.
